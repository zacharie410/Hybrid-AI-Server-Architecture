### HASA (Hybrid AI Server Architecture)is a framework for building scalable and robust AI systems. The architecture is designed to leverage the strengths of both server-side and client-side processing, allowing for efficient and cost-effective AI development.

## Architecture
HASA utilizes a hybrid server model, where the server performs both server-side and client-side operations to achieve better performance, scalability, and reliability. The server acts as the authoritative source of truth for the AI system and data, while offloading certain computational tasks to the clients to reduce the workload on the server and improve the responsiveness of the system.

## Features
- Scalable: HASA is designed to be highly scalable, allowing AI systems to handle large amounts of data and traffic.
- Affordable: By offloading computational tasks to the clients, HASA reduces the workload on the server and can help reduce hosting costs.
- Robust: HASA is designed to be resilient to failures, ensuring that the system remains operational even in the face of hardware or network issues.
F- lexible: HASA can be adapted to a wide range of AI use cases, from natural language processing to computer vision.

## How it Works
In HASA, the server offloads certain computational tasks to the clients to reduce the workload on the server and improve the responsiveness of the system. This means that some of the processing is done on the client-side, rather than on the server. For example, in a computer vision system, the server might send an image to the client, which then processes the image and sends the results back to the server. By doing this, the server can handle more requests at once, while still providing a fast and responsive experience to the user. This offloading of tasks is a key feature of the HASA architecture and contributes to its scalability and affordability.
